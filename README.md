# sentiment-classifier

I choose a dataset on reviews on womens clothing on E-commerce, which I then focus on the reviews as well as the rating for each review. The ratings for each review is ranged from 1 to 5, with the mean being around 4.20 and a standard deviation being at 1.11. Hence I decided on my sentiment classification by assigining a rating of 5 to positive[2], a rating of 4 to neutral[1], and a rating of 3 and below to negative[0]. For my preprocessing method, I also dropped all the reviews that have NaN as Review Text.
