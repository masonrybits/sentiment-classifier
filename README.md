# sentiment-classifier

I choose a dataset on reviews on womens clothing on E-commerce, which I then focus on the reviews as well as the rating for each review. The ratings for each review is ranged from 1 to 5, with the mean being around 4.20 and a standard deviation being at 1.11. Hence I decided on my sentiment classification by assigining a rating of 5 to positive[2], a rating of 4 to neutral[1], and a rating of 3 and below to negative[0]. For my preprocessing method, I also dropped all the reviews that have NaN as Review Text. 

I chose 'sigmoid', 'relu' and 'linear' for my activation because I have found them used quite often in other examples. My training has 3 layers with the final layer giving out 3 outputs. My accurancy was not great, highest at 0.4496 after the 1st epochs, and decreases as I ran more epochs.
